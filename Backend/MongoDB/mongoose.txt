# Schema:

    Think of a Schema as a Blueprint
    It tells Mongoose how a document should be shaped

    1 Virtuals -> 
        Virtual are document properties that you can get and set but that do not saved in DB.   
        to use it in schema set toJSON: { virtuals: true } in document

    2. Validation -> 
        validation is defined in the schema type
        validation is middleware. Mongoose registers validation as a pre('save') hook on every schema by default.
        Validation always runs as the first pre('save') hook. This means that validation doesn't run on any changes you make in pre('save') hooks.
        You can disable automatic validation before save by setting the validateBeforeSave option
        The unique Option is Not a Validator

# Models:

    A model is a class with which we construct documents with properties and behaviours as declared in our schema.

# Mongoose Middleware (hooks):
    Middleware are useful for atomizing model logic

    Mongoose has 4 types of middleware
        1. document middleware
        2. model middleware
        3. aggrgate middleware
        4. query middleware

    Pre middleware: 
        pre middleware functions are executed one after another, when each middleware calls next.
    
    Post middleware:
        post middleware are executed after the hooked method and all of its pre middleware have completed.

#Populate: 

    Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified path in the document with document from other colletions
    We may populate a single document, multiple documents, a plain object, multiple plain objects, or all objects returned from a query
