    # System Design:
        -> High level of planning & structuring of how web application works as a whole.
        -> System Design is the practice of planning and defining the architecture, components, data flow, and technologies of a software application before writing the code

            * key aspects of System Design
            1. Architecture
            2. Frontend Design
            3. Backend Design
            4. Database Design
            5. Scalabilitys
            6. Data Flow
            7. Security
    

    # Frontend Architecture:

        Frontend architecture is the structure and design of everything that runs on user's browser. It's concerned with the user interface (UI) & user experience (UX).
         
        Primary goal: to create fast, reliable, scalable & maintanable application that provides the excellent experience for the user
        
        Key concepts: 
            1. UI components & structure
            2. State management
            3. Routing
            4. Build & deployment
            5. Performance optimization

    
    # Backend Architecture: 
        Backend architecture is the structure and design of everything that runs on the server. It's concerned with business logic, data processing, security, and integration.

        Primary goal: to reliably serve data, enforce business rules, handle security, and communicate with other services, all while being scalable and efficient
        
        Key concepts:
            1. Application logic
            2. Data persistence & databases
            3. API design
            4. Authentication & authorization
            5. Caching
