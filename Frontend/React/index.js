    # Custom hooks
        - A custom hook is a javascript function that starts with use & internally calls other hooks like useState, useEffect, or useContext. It allows developers to extract reusable logic, keeping components clean and modular.
        - Steps to create Custom Hook: 
            1. Define a Function That Starts with use
            2. Use React's Built-in Hooks Inside Your Custom Hook
            3. Return Necessary Values
        - When to Use Custom Hooks:
            1. We need to reuse logic across multiple components.
            2. We want to improve readability and maintainability by keeping component logic clean.
